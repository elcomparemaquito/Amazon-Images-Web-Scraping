# Amazon Image Web Scraping

Just started working on this project. I'm currently working with a PC parts retailer and just finished setting up their new e-commerce website, with more than 2000 products available for sale. The owner of this company only gave me the technical information for the products, so he commended me with the task of uploading manually all the images.
Fortunately, I came up with the idea of scraping the images from EBay/Amazon. Fair warning, it is not finished yet, and I do believe it does not even work at the moment.
